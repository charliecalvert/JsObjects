## MongoTalk

Insert data into a MongoDb database and read it back.

There are two files, **Server01** and **Server02**. At this time, only **Server01** is working.

At the top of Server01 are several URLs. Ensure that **MongoClient.connect** is using the correct URL.

I've upgraded this code to work with MongoDb 3.XXX. A number of fixes were required.
