  <h1>Mongo Talk 02</h1>

  <p>A simple Node Express program with MongoDb support.</p>

  <p>This program assumes you have MongoDb setup locally or
    on a server. You should also have already run MongoTalk to
    insert some data into the "built-in" MongoDb test database.</p>

  <p><strong>jQuery</strong> has been stripped out. We
    use <strong>fetch</strong> and <strong>createElement</strong> instead.</p>
