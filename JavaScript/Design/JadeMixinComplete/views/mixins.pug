            | I've been working with computers and writing code in one form or
            | another for about 25 years. I started out with Turbo Pascal and Delphi,
            | spent time with Java, C++, Python and Perl, and then spent a number of
            | years working in C#.
        p.well
            | I've spent most of my career in industry, working first for Borland,
            | then for a start up in Silicon Valley, and until a few years ago I
            | was at Microsoft on the C# team. Over the last few years I've been
            | interested primarily in Agile Development, the cloud and various mobile devices.
        p.well
            | I'm always looking for ways to learn more about how we write web
            | and mobile applications that use Cloud services. I also look for
            | ways to learn more about virtual machines, cloud resources and mobile devices.
        p.well
            | I enjoy hiking, snow-shoeing, swimming, reading and watching movies.
            | I also like to write. I'm known in the computer world primarily as a book author:
