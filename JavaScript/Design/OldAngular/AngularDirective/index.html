		<h1>Directives</h1>
		
		<p>Directives allow you to attach attributes to an HTML tag. For instance,
		you could associated a class, id, name, etc to a DOM element (HTML tag)
		with a directive. In Angular, there are lots of built in directives, such
		as np-app, ng-controller, etc. This application shows how to write your
		own directives. In particular, a directive call showPicture, which takes
		boolean value.</p>
