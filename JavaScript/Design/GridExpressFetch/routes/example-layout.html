<h1>Canonical One</h1>

<p>This is an example layout <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_CSS_Grid_Layout#A_responsive_layout_with_1_to_3_fluid_columns_using_grid-template-areas">found on MDN</a>.</p>

<p>We try to avoid reinventing the wheel. As a rule, most of the layouts you need have been created by someone else. Find where they are done right, and use them.</p>

<p>In this layout, we display the areas in source order for any screen less that 500 pixels wide. We go to a two column layout, and then to a three column layout by redefining the grid, and the placement of items on the grid.</p>
