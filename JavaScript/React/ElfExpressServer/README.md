# Elf React Redux Server

This project uses `create-react-app`, Redux and a Node Express server.

You can run the server inside a docker container. Be sure to look at the proxy property in client/package.json.

## Run

The app uses [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently). Executing `npm start` instructs `concurrently` boots both the client and server. To start the program, type:

```
npm start
```
