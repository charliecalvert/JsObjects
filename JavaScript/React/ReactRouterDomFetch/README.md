## Overview

To create this app, I used a custom tool called **elf-express** which I installed like this:

        npm i -g elf-express
         
## Node Server

Basic node server with support for:

- webpack
- babel
- nodemon
- bower (For legacy code only. Don't use in most cases)

To run:

    npm i
    npm run build
    npm start

## React Router DOM

Install:

        npm i react react-dom
        npm i react-router-dom
        npm i style-loader css-loader

## Client Side

Start your client side code by editing **source/control.js** and adding **react-dom**.

Create react function components **Part One** and **Part Two**.

**react-router-dom** is used in **App.js**.

Note **root** in **index.pug**.
