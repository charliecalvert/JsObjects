        <h1>Loading JavaScript</h1>
        
        <p>This example shows how to load a javascript file dynamically at run time. Here is
        	the file that does the loading:</p>
        <p><a href="index.js">index.js</a></p>
        <p>Here is the file that is loaded:</p>
        <p><a href="ScriptToLoad.js">ScriptToLoad.js</a></p>
        <p>As you can see, the file that is loaded does nothing more than change the background
        	color of the page.</p>
