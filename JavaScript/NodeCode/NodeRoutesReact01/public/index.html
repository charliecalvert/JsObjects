        <h1>Node Routes React 01</h1>

        <p>This program is currently broken. See NodeRoutesReact03.</p>

        <p>
            Convert NodeRoutes01 to use React. This version of
            the program is problematic for two reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>It is not modularized. All the code is in index.js.</li>
            <li>It uses jQuery instead of React state. Once we switch to React, we should abandon jQuery.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            See NodeRoutesReact02 for the resolution of these issues.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've kept this program, despite its flaws, because it demonstrates
            some ways to convert existing jQuery projects into React projects.
            Sometimes it is not possible to convert all the modules of your
            project completely to a new paradigm, but this helps us get started
            on the conversion. At times I think it is also useful to see partially
            converted projects because it helps us understand what parts of a
            new technology, do what. "Oh, I see, we can still manipulate the DOM
            with jQuery, it is just that React provides a better way to do it."
