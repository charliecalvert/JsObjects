AzureSimpleDb05 adds 
	- bulkInsert, 
	- support for MiddleName and possibly other 
	- More tests
	
To set up:

1) Create keys.config, as explained in public\javascripts\utilities.js
2) Install express, simpledb and node-uuid. Like this:

npm install

This command processes the contents of package.json and is the 
equivalent of running the following: 

npm install express
npm install simpledb
npm install node-uuid
