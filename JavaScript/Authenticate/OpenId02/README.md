OpenId
======

There are two files in this directory:

* server01.js: This the Elvenware demo I want to focus on.
* OpenIdDemo.js: This is a sample demo from the folks who made the openid package

The server01.js sample relies on Express and OpenId. The openid package is
hosted here:

<https://github.com/havard/node-openid>

To install Express and OpenId, just type:

	npm install
	
This command will process the contents of package.json, which 
contains references to both Express and OpenId.
